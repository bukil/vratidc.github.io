## About ARTWO

ARTWO is an app that demonstrates how you can use a second phone to interact with Handheld Augmented Reality Experiences. We will be presenting ARTWO as a demonstration at UIST 2020 ([project page](/projects/dualphonear)), but if you'd like to try the app out yourselves, or watch videos about it, this page is for that.

- You can download the ARTWO APK for installation on most Android Phones.
- You will need two phones with this app - one to run AR, and the other to control it.
- Only some phones can support AR. ARTWO will tell you if it can run on your device.

**Download:** [ARTWO Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bBPpoMARL-Ux0KBF1Ny62KvzEcZWdGPZ/view?usp=sharing)

***The Google Play Store link will be up shortly, we're fixing a few networking bugs at the moment. The version of the app shared through the Google Drive link above still works, though it may face a few connection issues at times.***
