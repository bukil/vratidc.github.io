## About ARCheck

ARCheck is a simple Android app that helps you find out whether your phone can run the AR experiments and studies conducted by us.

The application does not collect any personal user data.

When you use this app, we anonymously log whether a phone can support AR or not. **We do not store your name, location, phone details in any way**.

For any further questions, please contact us at [hello@imxd.in](mailto:hello@imxd.in)
