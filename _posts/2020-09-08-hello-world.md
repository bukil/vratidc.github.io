Hey there! Welcome to the IMXD blog. 

We will be updating this section with posts about our ongoing projects, calls for participating in our studies, explorations by our students and team members, as well as news & updates about our work.

While we're starting this in September 2020, the IMXD lab has been active and doing a lot of work for a few years now. We'll be documenting those projects through archive posts that will be appearing over the coming months.

You can also view posts sorted by category and tags by clicking on the relevant links.

Please do keep checking this space for future posts and updates.
