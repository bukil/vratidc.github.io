This autumn, team IMXD will be represented (virtually) at four conferences - UIST, VRST, ISMAR, and ISS!

The ScholAR team led by Prof. Jayesh and Pratiti will be organising a workshop titled **"Towards Designing a Mobile Augmented Reality Learning Experience"** at [ISMAR 2020](http://ismar20.org/). The workshop page is linked here - [ISMAR workshop 2020](/workshops/ISMAR2020). 

Richa's final B.Des project on designing a mobile AR application for vocational skill training will be presented as a poster at [ISS 2020](https://iss.acm.org/2020/).

Rishi's final M.Des project on mobile AR interaction methods (and the use of a second phone as a controller in particular) will be presented as a demo at [UIST 2020](http://uist.acm.org/uist2020/), and a poster at [VRST 2020](http://vrst.acm.org/vrst2020/). You can read more about his work here - [Dual Phone AR Project Page](/projects/dualphonear).

In case you're attending any of these conferences, please do drop by our presentations!
