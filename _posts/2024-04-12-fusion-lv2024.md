Fusion, that is, ‘File Transfer and Universal Sync for Immersive & Other Networks’, is an XR project focused on making interactions which cater to sync between virtual and non-immersive platforms/devices.

This academic project was conceptualised, designed, developed and tested within a two-week timeframe. The prototype was created during the two-week course ‘Design for Virtual Reality’, in the spring semester of 2023, under the guidance of [Prof. Jayesh PIllai](http://www.idc.iitb.ac.in/people/faculty/pillai-jayesh){:target="_blank"}.

A brief explanation of the project is presented in the video below:
