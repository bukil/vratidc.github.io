 We're conducting a study on using **Mobile Augmented Reality for Remote Learning**, as part of the [ScholAR Project](/projects/scholar), where we are testing a **Collaborative AR Classroom** that we've developed, focusing on **Mathematics for classes 6 to 8**. 
        
If you are a mathematics teacher who would like to be a part of this study along with your class, or know teachers or schools who might be interested in participating, please fill this form - [ScholAR Call for Participants](https://forms.gle/h5u2yWw6EVGbp11G8) - and we'll get in touch with you to discuss further. Thanks!
