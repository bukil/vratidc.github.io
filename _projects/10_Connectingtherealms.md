content_one1: Connecting the realms provides an augmented reality interface to alter properties and behaviors of physical objects. It uses Fluid Interface's Reality Editor to give the user easy control over daily objects. The user points his phone to the object and an interface pops up giving the information and control layouts along with the services related to the object. In addition to that, it also allows us to establish relationships between digital objects for accomplishing a common task.
