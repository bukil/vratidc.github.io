Till We Meet Again is a multi-storyline live-action VR film that was built with [Cinévoqué]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/Cinevoque).

## Abstract

This film presents an emotional journey of a small family, as seen from the father's perspective. The user would be immersed in a space that is dear to the character, who is waiting for something or someone. Based on the users' point of view and attention to specific details within that space, the story unfolds. In addition to the 360° narrative, this film presents the user with a stereo 3D and spatial audio experience. The experience has six possible endings and eight storylines.

Each storyline has a different genre and the storylines are completely unlike each other.
