content_one1: IDC Run is an obstacle runner game in VR where the player has to reach a particular destination before time runs out. The game is modelled around IDC and within IIT Bombay campus, and is based on the life of IDC students. The player balances himself on an actual skateboard and uses it to move sideways or jump in the virtual space. He avoids obstacles in the road and collects coins which are a part of his teaching allowance.
