overview: Currently no typing support exists for Indic scripts, especially for Devanagari text input. Introducing ‘Svar’, a tool designed as an attempt to streamline Devanagari script input within virtual reality environments. Our aim is to enable users to type in Devanagari characters using intuitive hand gestures.<br<br>But Svar isn't just about convenience; it's about immersion. Our keyboard tries to integrate Devanagari script seamlessly into VR environments, opening up new possibilities for exploration and expression.
