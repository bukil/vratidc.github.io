ArchDeck is a collaborative ecosystem consisting of a Hololens and a desktop application. The ecosystem allows architects and designers to work in collaboration being present remotely or/and locally in real-time using mixed reality.

Archdeck was developed by Vineet Kamboj as part of his M.Des final project in 2018.
