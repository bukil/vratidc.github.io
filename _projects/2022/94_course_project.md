overview: SolidAR is a learning tool for students who are learning the basics of platonic and Archimedean solids. It goes a step beyond the usual 2d representation and gives you a tangible impression of solids. By using the markers, it is a fun and intuitive way of grasping concepts. There is also information given about each solid which can be noticed in the AR.
