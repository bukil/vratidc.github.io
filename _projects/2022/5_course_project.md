overview: Amaze is an interactive virtual reality game where the player is trapped in an endless simulation and the only way out is to solve the maze. As soon as the player mounts the VR headset, the madness begins. The clues hidden in every nook and corner of the game will lead the player to the end of the maze and to the final twist. Taking every opportunity to spook out the player, this game explores an eerie environment in first-person perspective.
