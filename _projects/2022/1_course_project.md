overview: Vaango is a VR game which uses spatial audio, directing you to collectable artifacts, ending in a celebration of life and culture, an analogy for going back to your roots. The Narrative is inspired from the song ‘Enjoy Enjammi’ by Dhee & Arivu, which also acts as the guiding soundtrack for the player.
