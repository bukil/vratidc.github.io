overview: 'Steal Like an Artist' is a mobile VR game designed and developed in Unity. The objective of the game is purely entertainment. In this game, the player is supposed to enter the museum and steal the objects that belong to India. It has three different stages with increasing levels of difficulty; the end goal of the player is to complete all three levels and, in the last level, steal the Kohinoor. The main interactions that we are using here are - gaze-based interaction and proximity interaction, along with the audio instructions and feedback. The game is accessible to all through a virtual reality HMD having a button.
