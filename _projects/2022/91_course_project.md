overview: Re-imagining the invisible cities by Italo Calvino into a VR experiential space, where literature meets multimedia. Olinda is an open-world VR experience which opens up a possibility for fiction readers to experience stories and become a part of it. Here you can explore the surroundings under a magnificent stretch of the night sky, through the rocky terrain and cities that have memories of the past. Starting from the middle, the city grows outward in concentric circles, giving experience of a different city with each passing step. Interact with the elements in the environment, find and collect various artifacts.
