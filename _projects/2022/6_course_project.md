overview: The world of Glimmer is post-apocalyptic. This is a globe that has endured the horrors of humanity, and as a result of nuclear wars and global warming, it has turned into a place that is unfit for human habitation. This game
provokes thought and is a satire on the status of humanity today. A quest to collect plants and save your family who have lost their resources. Your chances of survival are slim, but will you be able to collect plants and survive, or will you perish from dehydration in the toxic environment?
