overview: 'The Gregarian Skirmish' is a 2 player marker-based AR game. The game follows a storyline where the two war chiefs (Player 1 & Player 2) from the planet of Gregaria set out in search of a mystic energy source. The war chiefs found out that the one who acquires the mystic energy source will become the supreme commander of Gregaria. So they fight with each other using the army that is given to them. The winner will acquire the mystic energy source. The game is designed based on proximity sensing between different image targets and image target recognition. Players are given a set of cards and each time a card is placed the character pops up and interacts with the opponentâ€™s character. Each win will reward the player with a hexagonal card. The objective of the game is to unlock a magical object by winning 6 hexagonal cards. These 6 hexagonal cards will be used to form an enclosure around the target card which unlocks the mystic energy source.
