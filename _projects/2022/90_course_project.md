overview: Vantage Point is a fun game designed to explore the VR experience. The game area consists of various monuments. Amongst these, a few of them are floating and fragmented into triangles of different sizes. The objective of the game is to identify the exact spot from which the fragmented monuments can be viewed as a complete object. The user has to navigate around the entire space and reach the correct point on the pathway. Currently, the demo level has 5 distorted monuments. The game can be extended by adding more levels to it with varied themes. The difficulty of the game can be further increased by adding a time limit to the game. Adding elements like energy cubes to increase the time limit will make the game more challenging.
