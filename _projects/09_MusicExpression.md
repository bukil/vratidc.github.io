As part of a course on Design for Virtual Reality, the team of Amarnath, Maulashree and Rishi designed a VR application to help novice musicians gain a visual intuition for music theory concepts like harmony and scales. They created the virtual environments which consisted of visual landscapes that responded to a player's musical input. 

The physical position and scale of the real electronic keyboard was mapped to the virtual environment, and the Leap Motion sensor was used to allow players to see their hands in VR.
