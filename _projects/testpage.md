This is an ongoing work that started out as Amarnath and Amal's summer internship project in 2018. The framework and the experiences built with it has been presented at multiple national and international conferences, which are listed below.


## Abstract

The grammar of storytelling in Cinematic Virtual Reality (CVR) is still evolving and is not as established as traditional movies due to its immersive nature. Unlike traditional films where the director decides the framing of the visuals shown, in CVR, the viewers have control over the point of view (POV). As a result, they are likely to miss important events in the narrative by focusing elsewhere in the virtual environment. In our framework, Cinévoqué,  we take advantage of this feature to present an experience that tries to maintain consistency in the narrative seen by the viewer. It achieves this by following the viewer's gaze and the events in the film that it intersects with; if they miss an event that's pertinent to the rest of the storyline, the framework shifts to an alternate storyline that does not have said event as a presupposition. The transition takes place unbeknownst to the viewer so as not to interrupt the flow of the experience.

Cinévoqué is built for live-action CVR since real-time 3D experiences have the affordance of the framework implicitly. The novelty of this work lies in its intent to bring passive interactivity to an experience composed of live-action videos that are mostly immutable in real-time. Furthermore, adding a layer of real-time changes to live-action VR films allows for new use cases that were not previously possible.  For example, the experiences "Schrödinger's Vada-Pav" and  "Till We Meet Again" that was built with Cinévoqué have a virtual body that rotates to align with the user's physical body using 6DOF controller data.  Similarly, other data can be used to influence the visuals and audio in the experience.
