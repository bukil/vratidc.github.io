## Experimental Study
As part of the larger research work on "Understanding the Grammar of VR Storytelling", a study was conducted, focusing of the visual cues in 360 narratives. The Points-of-views and Cenre-of-Interests of 20 participants watching the 360 video were analysed, to gather insights regarding visual cues, and accordingly propose guidelines for VR film-makers.
