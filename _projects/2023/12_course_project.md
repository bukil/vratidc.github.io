overview: Jar is an immersive virtual reality (VR) experience. It's an attempt to explore a radicalized workspace layout moving away from the conventional 2D digital desktops and moving towards a physical desktop metaphor. The exploration involves new ways of visualizing and interacting with data. Jar can be thought of a space with containers having information inside. The goal is to provide its user the freedom to utilize the virtual space in personalizing data or their memories.
