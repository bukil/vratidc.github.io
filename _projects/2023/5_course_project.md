overview: PopOS is an attempt to explore amusing and playful interactions and apply them to basic functions of OS, like opening & closing applications/windows, accessing control panel settings and resizing of windows in a virtual space. The interactions are metaphorically drawn from pop culture, like Pokemon balls, Spiderman web shooting and Ironmanâ€™s left arm virtual control.
