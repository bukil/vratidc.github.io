overview: CAR experience is an immersive AR application in which we can view a car in its full scale using a phone or a tab. We can customise its features and drive it as well, all inside the comfort of our room. We can compare various cars and look at the interiors and specifications as well, so as to make a definitive decision about buying the car.
