overview: Fusion stands for file transfer and universal sync for immersive and other networks. Fusion is an exploration of novel, intuitive, one-handed interactions that connect virtual and physical worlds. In this project, we are primarily exploring four interactions, which include scrolling, text selection, text input using real-world devices, and file transfer between VR headset and non-immersive physical devices. This can be extended to various other use cases.
