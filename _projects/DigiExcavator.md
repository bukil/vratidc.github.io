## Introduction

This project was done as a part of a two week course 'Design for VR'. During which we ideated and prototyped VR based project. With DigiExcavator we intended to make JCB operation training easier and affordable using VR technology.

<br>

## The project

JCB Simulator is a Virtual reality simulator to help new drivers learn and practice in a virtual environment. This JCB simulator has physical controllers that are similar to the ones present in a JCB. A virtual environment with some haptic feedback can provide a better experience of real world scenar-ios. There are two clear benefits of using this. First, a trainee can receive his/her initial training not directly on road and under different environmental conditions. Second, the training cost and the risks involved during training can be highly reduced.

## Storyboard

The storyboard frame consists of steps involved in two major tasks of excavation process namely excavating rocks and soil and loading it to the cargo vehicle or a truck.

### Character Design

There are two main characters in the story. Sophie and Ammu are best friends. They care for each other. Both are mischievous and playful.

## Research and Inspirations

As part of research, I looked at current AR projects, Interactive storytelling including comics and storybooks. I also looked at books with physical interactivity.

## Explorations

### Slide AR

Slide AR is an augmented reality app where artists can upload layer by layer illustrations and view it in AR. But the disadvantage of the app is that you cannot export it.

### Adobe Aero

Adobe aero is another augmented reality app where you can upload the psd and view it as AR. It has a lot of options to add interactivity also without any coding knowledge. But the problem with the app is that you can only send through links to view this. And the export formats won't support unity or any other software. So you canâ€™t make it into an apk file.

### Unity

Augmented reality (AR) can be defined as the overlaying of digital content (images, video, text, sound) onto locations and it is typically experienced by looking through the camera of an electronic device such as a smartphone, tablets, etc.

### Using sprites

The illustration is kept as a marker for the content. Each layer is imported to unity as sprites and sprite animations. It is kept above the marker in the order of appearance and height. Sprite masking is also done to view it inside panels.

</figure>

In order to view it hold the illustration in front of the webcam. The layers and animation will appear above the illustration.

### Using video playback

Instead of uploading layer by layer, a video playback is kept by adding a video component for the marker. On viewing the marker illustration, an animated video will be playing.
