overview: Falling Apples in AR is a fun yet simple game which uses marker based augmented reality to generate 3D apples falling within the space. The objective of the game is to catch as many falling apples as possible. The user holds the marker in one hand which renders a 3D bowl in the space seen through the smartphoneâ€™s camera above the marker and the user has to hold their smartphone in another hand and play this game. In the space around the player, apples would be falling from random directions within a 360 degrees plane. The game allows the user to experience movement in six degrees of freedom. If the apples touch the bowl, or fall inside it the score increases. We developed this game on Vuforia Engine in Unity 3D. The game runs on two major C# scripts one of which is to spawn and generate apples till the time game continues and another one to increase score variable when the apples fall on the marker rendered 3D bowl meant for catching apples. For the given time and scope, this project deploys this simple game strategy which could be extended to a more complex game logic like introducing the concept of rotten apples which reduces the game score in order to make the game more interesting and adding further levels to it.
