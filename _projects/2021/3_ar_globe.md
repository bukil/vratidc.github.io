overview:  Our AR Globe is a physical globe with the world map printed on it. A person with the AR Globe app can scan their phone over this physical globe. The app’s image tracking API reads markers for each country placed on it and pops up 3D models of important landmarks of each along with a greeting in the national language. A person can chose to explore more information about that country while the app’s AR camera is still active. The information displayed in a flexible card layout can cater to varied interest groups- from general information to news and stock market activity, history, geography, politics and much more. As the person moves the phone away from the defined range for one country to the next, the app reacts by popping up a new 3D model.
