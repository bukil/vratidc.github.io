overview: We designed a location and audio based AR treasure-hunt game. In this game one would start at a specific location with an initial clue. Each clue has to be followed to reach the next location. In this game one has to rely on the spatial audio to navigate and find the treasure box. There are certain easter eggs as well at specific spots.
