overview: This is a location based treasure hunt game, where the clues are displayed in AR, and sound is used to locate the clues. The user has to start at the start point with an initial clue. Then they must follow the clues, and reach the spot.  They can then seek out the treasure box with  music  volume as a radar (doppler effect). The treasure box becomes visible as they approach, and in close proximity with the keyhole  the treasure opens and gives the next clue. They must then continue and find the final treasure at the end of the game and they can also look out for Easter eggs. The AR+GPS Location package brings the ability to position 3D objects in real-world geographical locations via their GPS coordinates using Unity and Augmented-Reality. It supports both Unity's AR Foundation and Vuforia. Each location marker is associated with a certain prefab, whoâ€™s properties we can customise. We use colliders to detect the player's proximity and 3D sound for the audio input.
