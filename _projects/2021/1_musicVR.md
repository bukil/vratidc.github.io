overview: We designed a VR application to help novice musicians gain a visual intuition for music theory concepts like harmony and scales. We created virtual environments which consisted of visual landscapes that respond to a player's musical input. The physical position and scale of the real electronic keyboard was mapped to the virtual environment, and the Leap Motion sensor was used to allow players to see their hands in VR.
