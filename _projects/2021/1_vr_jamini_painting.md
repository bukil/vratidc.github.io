overview: Through VR, we wish to bring 2D static paintings to life through layered elements recreated in the painting style of Jamini Roy. Jamini Roy was an Indian Artist consciously rejected Western artistic styles and developed a more 'Indian' form of artistic expression. Virtual reality allows for more immersive art experiences that engage the user to explore beyond the 2 Dimensions of traditional art. We aimed to bring various scenes from his paintings to life by placing the different elements from 5 different paintings with supporting experiential audio, set among a village rendered in the painting style of the artist. We see application of such an immersive experience in art museums and schools to tell stories and view traditional Indian art in a new interactive way.
